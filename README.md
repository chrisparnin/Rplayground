# Playground

Illustrates behaviors of code snippets in Python and R for processing the Titantic datset.

### Setting up environment

If you do not have python/R running locally, you can use [Baker](https://getbaker.io)!

* Install [baker](https://docs.getbaker.io/installation/). Then run `baker bake` inside this directory.

You can run `baker ssh` and `cd /Rplayground` to experiment with code. You can also run `baker run R` and `baker run py` to run example snippets.
